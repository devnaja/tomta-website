            A loyalty application is a mobile application designed to enhance
            customer loyalty and engagement for businesses. It serves as a
            platform through which businesses can implement and manage customer
            loyalty programs. The primary purpose of a loyalty app is to
            incentivize repeat business, encourage customer retention, and
            reward users for their ongoing loyalty to a brand or business.
